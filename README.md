## Quick start
  
Importing gridle

  import "gridle/gridle"

Configure your grid :

  $gridle-columns-count : 12;
  $gridle-gutter-width : 20px;
  - and many more options...

Register states (media queries) (optional) :

  @include gridle_register_state('tablet',401px,767px);
  @include gridle_register_state('mobile',0,400px);
  @include gridle_register_state('print', 'only print');
  - make the use of media queries really easy

Generate all classes :

  @include gridle_generate_classes();

Use your grid in hrml :

  <div class="container">
    <div class="grid-12 hide-print">
      Header
    </div>
    <div class="grid-8 grid-mobile-12">
      Content
    </div>
    <div class="grid-4 grid-mobile-12 hide-print">
      Sidebar
    </div>
  </div>

Or with mixins :

  .container {
    @include gridle_container();
    max-width:960px;
    margin:0 auto;
  }
  #header {
    @include gridle(12);
  }
  #sidebar {
    @include gridle(8);
    @include gridle(12, 'mobile');
  }
  #sidebar {
    @include gridle(4);
    @include gridle_hide('mobile');
  }
  @footer {
    @include gridle(12);
  }

Customize your content look and feel with Gridle mixins

  #sidebar {
    background : red;

    @include gridle_state('mobile') {
      background : green;
    }
  }
